Thrift Server : 

Backend Daemon Service which runs the the Hive Engine
Daemon Service will listen to incoming request for Hive Engine
It is used to listen programmatically by ODBC/JDBC for Hive Engine





Hive Driver :

Controller for HQL statements
Creates sessions for Query
Maintain Lifecycle of HQL
maintain metadata for execution
Collects output and display

SQL check :

Syntax & Symentics --> Execution plan --> Optimization --> Processing.

Parsing + Planner -> Compilation :

Syntax check --> Execution plan --> Steps to get the Output --> Raise Compile Time Error.

Optimiser :

It will perform permuttation & combination 
Compare Execution plans --> Calculate Cost --> Execution plan/DAG --> Try to place or combine transformations together 
Eg : groupby + where (e1 plan) , where + groupby (e2 plan) 

Hive Metastore :

It used to store metadata of the actual data like db, table, schema etc.
It uses Derby DB by default RDBMS but fault here is we can't use more than 1 connections ( eg. connecting multiple from multiple programs ).
Anytime reinstalling hive the derby db info data will be removed.


P1 --> (ok) --> Hive
P2 --> (Not) ---> Hive

External Metastore : 

Multiple concurrent connections
Metadata Backup
Data Security
Expose to external use cases ( We can check how tables created, volumes of data grown, space cleanup, automated script)
