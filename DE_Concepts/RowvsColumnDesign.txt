Row vs column design 

 Eg : Spotify Design
1) Column Design 

User id, app-installed-date, in-app-purschase-date, unistalled-date
1, 2020/9/10,                  ,2020/10/12
2, 2020/2/13, 2020/3/12        , 

First we are inserting 2 rows 
Every time new purchase, unistallement etc happens we need to update the record 
if suppose their are 1 million rows and any above updates happens it needs to be done on those rows &  many null values 
will also be present inside it, so it's costly operation interms of execution & space 

2) Row Design 

User_id, Activity_name, date
1, app-installed-date, 2020/9/10
2, app-installed-date ,2020/2/13
1, unistalled-date, 2020/10/12'
2,in-app-purschase-date, 2020/3/12

In row design we converted column into row values of activity column so
any changes happens will be inserted as new record
In Column design we needed to search user_id to update the record in row design we just need to insert any update 

Condition 
if we need to add new column as ( app-premium-purchase )
then in column design we to add column & it's not preferred in production 
But in row design we only need to insert the change no need to change structure of data model 


Report
for report we need to have columns to just apply select query and get the columns 
which can is achieved in column design
but for row design we need to convert it into columns 

Which column not to convert to rows
user_id, dob, joining_date.
dob, joining_date will be inserted one time, so no changes or updates happens on this column

Note : 
For event driven system use row design data model to capture changes efficiently 
Row design are efficient for database, OLTP systems
Column Design are efficient for datawarehouse, OLAP systems
