Dynamo NoSQL DB
--------------------
 - It's key value, columnar database
 - Flexible schema
 - Horizontal Scaling
 - Columns in each row are different
 - No relational 
 - We can use SQL for querying
 - Uses JSON for interaction
 - Uses Partition key + sort key (optional) as primary key
 - It's uses views and global indexes


- 2 tables with same name in different region within one account can be treated as different table

- It doesn't have relation so no table join which gives high query performance % they don't enfore strict relation

- Only common each item in table should be present is the primary key.


Data types in Dynamo DB
------------------------------

1) Scalar Types 
 - Exactly one vaue
 - string, boolean, null etc
 - Keys or index attributes only support string,number & binary( compressd text, images) scalar types


2) Set Types
  - Multiple scalar values
  - eg : string set, number set, binary set

3) Document Types
 - Complex structure with nested attributes
 - eg : list and map
 -  strucure over 32 level deep

Asynchronous Replication
------------------------

- Dynamo db stores least 3 copies of the data on high speed SSD within a region
- Act as Independent Failure Domains
- Near real time replication


Dynamo DB Read Consistency
---------------------------

1) Strong Consisteny
 - The most up-to-date data
 - Must be requested explicitly

2) Eventual Consistency
 - May or may not reflect the lastest copy of data
 - Default consistency for all operations
 - 50% cheaper


DynampDB Capacity Units
--------------------------

Throughput Capacity
 - Allows for performance at scale
 - Used to control read/wrtie throughput
 - Supports auto scaling
 - Defined using RCUs and WCUs
 - Major factor in Dynamodb pricing
 - 1 capacity unit = 1 request/sec


RCUs
----------------------------
 - 1 RCU = 1 strong consistent table reads/sec
 - 1 RCU = 2 eventually consistent table reads/sec
 - In blocks of 4 kB


WCUs
----------------------------
  - Write Capacity Units
  - 1 WCU = 1 table write/sec 
  - In blocks of 1 kb
