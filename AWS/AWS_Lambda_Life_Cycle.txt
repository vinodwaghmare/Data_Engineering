AWS Lambda Life Cycle Phase
=====================================================




Phase 1: INT Phase
--------------------------------------------------

Extension INIT
RUNTIME INIT
FUNCTION STATIC INIT

RUNTIME INIT: It builds the runtime as per define

FUNCTION INIT: It builds the function init which is used for the code mentioned outside the event handler function, 
              eg: make a connection with db we do it one time, so every time the request invokes lambda the code outside handler will not execute and remains static,
                    it only works once.

Extension INT





Phase 2: INVOKE Phase
--------------------------------------------------

At this phase, lambda is available to take requests and respond 
At first time invocation the lambda will have call start ( build runtime )
After the first invocation the lambda will have a warm start to take multiple requests






Phase 3: SHUTDOWN Phase
---------------------------------------------------

Runtime shutdown
Extension shutdown

It shut down the runtime & if the runtime extension doesn't respond to lambda call it in 2 sec then it terminates using sigkill
