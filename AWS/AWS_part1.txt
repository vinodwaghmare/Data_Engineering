S3 Objects :
Uploaded or created data/files in s3 bucket

S3 URI (Universal Resource Identifier):
It's the absolute path for any object inside the s3
s3:///bucket/folder/file.txt
filesystem:///bucket_name/prefix/object_name


key -> prefix + object_name
folder/file.txt
key is used to locate each object in s3


Amazon Resource Locator ( ARN ) :
It is used for interaction between services

arn:aws:s3:///bucket/folder/file.txt  -> arn for object
arn:aws:s3:///bucket  -> arn for bucket

Eg: AWS lambda needs to interact with AWS bucket so in bucket policy we need to mention  ARN of lambda function 

Object URL :
It's kind of endpoint generated for object so it can be accessed publicily using api etc
https://bucket/region/folder/file.txt
