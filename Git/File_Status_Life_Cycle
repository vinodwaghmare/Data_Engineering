File Status LifeCycle

1) Untracked :
When we create or add files inside the git repository which are by default untracted by the VCS.

2) Unmodified : 
When we move the untracked files into staging area then those files gets tracked by VCS.

3) Modified :
Any changes done on the tracked file or edit the file which was in the staging area it will be modified 

4) Staged : 
Modified files are ready to be staged for final commit and then moved it into unmodified form.


untracked ---> add file ---> unmodified ---> edit the file ---> modified ---> stage the file --> stage ----> commmit ---> unmodified
